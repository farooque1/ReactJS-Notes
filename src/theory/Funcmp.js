            <p>Components let you split the UI into independent, 
            reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.</p>
            <p>Functional components are some of the more common components that will come 
            across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions.</p>
            <p>We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function.
             These functions may or may not receive data as parameters. </p>
